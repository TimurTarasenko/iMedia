#KNOWN BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

- No spining process indicator while downloading thubnails.
- Currently the combo view works better than IKImageBrowser view
- IKImageBrowser issues:
  - No incremental loding. Images are shown after _all_ thumbnails have been downloaded.
  - Often one and the same image is showing up on several spots in the browser. The combow view is showing unique images, though.
- Once a request has been started, there is no way to cancel it.
